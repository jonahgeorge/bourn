  Bourn
</h1>

<p>Bourn is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">microblogging</a> platform made for people annoyed with the current trends of mainstream media platforms.</p>
<p>
  Void of ads and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a> news articles, the focus here is on the content.
  While other platforms currently exist that fill this need, they each have their own advantages and disadvantages.

<ul>
  <li>Stellar performance on all platforms</li>
  <li>Guarding against spam users by requiring payment</li>
  <li>Simple chronological timelines</li>
  <li>No needless length restrictions on posts</li>
</ul>
