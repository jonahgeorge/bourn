  Bourn
</h1>

<p>Bourn is a <a href="/">microblogging</a> platform made for people annoyed with the current trends of mainstream media platforms.</p>
<p>
  Void of ads and clickbait news articles, the focus here is on the content.
  While other platforms currently exist that fill this need, they each have their own advantages and disadvantages.
</p>

<p><strong>What sets Bourn apart</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Stellar performance on all platforms</li>
  <li>Guarding against spam users by requiring payment</li>
  <li>Simple chronological timelines</li>
  <li>No needless length restrictions on posts</li>
</ul>
