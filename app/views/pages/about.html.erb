<p><strong>About the wordmark</strong></p>

<p>"Bourn", meaning "a small stream, especially one that flows intermittently or seasonally" is a play on words when compared to Twitter.</p>

<p>Twitter has the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/18/twitter-puts-trillions-tweets-for-sale-data-miners">"Firehose API"</a> which boasts an impressive 1,000 tweets per second. As Bourn is advertised as a "Twitter competitor", I thought it would be funny to compare it to something like a stream or a garden hose. The name "Bourn" and the garden hose may change in the future, but I love the analogy to something that slowly streams (or even leaks) data.</p>
